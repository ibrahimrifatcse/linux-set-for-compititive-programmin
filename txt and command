For competitive programming, I use Ubuntu (a popular free Linux distribution) dual booted alongside Windows. My favorite IDE is Geany and it's perfect for short codes in CP, but I don't recommend it for work and big projects. Here's setup instructions.

Download Ubuntu from https://ubuntu.com/download.
Create a bootable USB with https://rufus.ie or any other software.
Install Ubuntu from your USB, preferably alongside the current OS (like Windows).
Open terminal in Activities or with ctrl+alt+T.
Install Geany and g++:
sudo apt install geany
sudo apt install g++
Configure Geany preferences:
6.1. Open preferences with ctrl+alt+P.
6.2. In Keybindings tab, set Switch to Editor as F1 and confirm overriding, then Switch to VTE as F2 (VTE is built-in terminal).
6.3. In Terminal tab, mark Follow path of the current file. Terminal will now automatically change a path after you open a new file.
6.4. (optional) In General -> Miscellaneous, unmark Beep on errors.
6.5. (optional) In Editor, change Comment toggle marker to an empty string or a single space.
6.6. (optional) In Editor > Display, unmark Stop scrolling at last line and Long line marker Enabled.
Open any C++ file in Geany, go to Build -> Set Build Commands and copy my flags.
Compile (F8): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o "%e" "%f" -O2 -Wno-unused-result
Build (F9): g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o "%e" "%f" -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG
If you get compilation errors, try changing from c++17 to c++14 and/or removing sanitizers (two fsanitize flags).
Open a file ~/.bashrc and uncomment a line #force_color_prompt=yes in order to get colorful terminal in Geany. In the same file, add a line ulimit -s 2000123 to set the stack limit to around 2GB. Restart geany (or your PC) or run source ~/.bashrc to trigger the change.
Optional steps which I use:

Hide Toolbar and Sidebar by unmarking them in View.
Install Guake and make it run on start-up:
sudo apt install guake
Activities (top-left corner) -> Startup Applications Preferences -> Add -> set name and command as guake
Open system settings (top-right corner of the screen) and mark Auto-hide the Dock in Dock tab.
Download Monokai theme from https://www.geany.org/download/themes/, change comment color to comment=#FF00FF and apply it in View > Change Color Scheme.
If underscores are not visible for some font sizes, use [styling]\nline_height=0;2; (https://github.com/geany/geany/issues/1387).
Grab testlib from https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/blob/master/testlib.h, add first line #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wshadow" and last line #pragma GCC diagnostic pop, move the file to /usr/local/include.
More info and details below.

You can install stuff by using Software Center or typing a command in terminal, usually sudo apt install program_name. This should be displayed if you just type geany (Command 'geany' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install geany). If this doesn't work, I usually google ubuntu how to install program_name from terminal and follow the instructions.
Guake allows you to summon a fullscreen terminal by clicking the F12 button, which is more comfortable than a new terminal window that you can open with ctrl+alt+T. It isn't important if you use Geany built-in terminal though.
Comment toggle marker refers to a special character added to comments created with shortcut ctrl+E in Geany. The default ~ means that commented lines will look like //~ int a = 2 + 2;. It's ok to get rid of the ~ character.
In Preferences -> Interface, you can switch the position of Geany terminal (and message window) between bottom and right.
python3 is likely already installed, consider defining python as the same command (more info) in terminal:
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10
Update: At the end of 2020, I decided to switch from dual boot to VM. The setup takes more effort but then I can code in Ubuntu while recording and drawing with Windows software.
